You can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><hr><h1 id="task">Task:</h1><p>You must finish the <code>Pong</code> class. It has a constructor which accepts the <code>maximum score</code> a player can get throughout the game, and a method called <code>play</code>. This method determines whether the current player hit the ball or not, i.e. if the paddle is at the sufficient height to hit it back. There're 4 possible outcomes: player successfully hits the ball back, player misses the ball, player misses the ball <strong>and his opponent reaches the maximum score winning the game</strong>, either player tries to hit a ball despite the game being over.
